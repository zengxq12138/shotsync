# shotsync

Your own cross-device image, text & file pool, deployable to Cloudflare's free tier in a few minutes. Drop a screenshot, photo, or file on one device, grab it on another. No app to install (the phone client is a PWA), no third-party image host — your data lives only in your own Cloudflare account.

**🎬 Live demo (read-only sample pool): https://shotsync-demo.defiabell.workers.dev**

## What it is

A single **Cloudflare Worker + R2 bucket** backing a small **PWA gallery**:

- Upload **images** (auto-converted to JPEG + thumbnailed client-side), **text** snippets, and arbitrary **files** (up to 25 MB each).
- View a newest-first feed on any device; tap to view full, **save/download**, or **delete**.
- Mint a **signed, expiring public link** to share one item — without exposing the rest of the pool.
- **Token-gated**: one shared secret unlocks the pool; everything else stays private.
- A **30-day transit pool** (auto-deleted), not an archive.

## Why

iCloud / AirDrop / network drives / public image hosts are either manual, ecosystem-locked, or route your (possibly work) screenshots through someone else's cloud. shotsync is a self-hosted, free, privacy-respecting take: data only moves between your devices and your own Cloudflare account.

## How it compares (LocalSend, PairDrop, messaging yourself)

The dividing line is **a live transfer vs. a pool that waits**. LocalSend and PairDrop connect two devices that are both awake right now and stream between them. shotsync keeps the item for 30 days, so the sending device can be asleep, on a different network, or in another country by the time you pick it up.

|  | shotsync | [LocalSend](https://localsend.org) | [PairDrop](https://pairdrop.net) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Both devices online at once | not required | required | required |
| Install | none (PWA in the browser) | an app on every device | none (browser) |
| Across different networks | yes | no — same local network | via a temporary public room |
| Where the bytes go | your own Cloudflare R2 | device to device, no server | peer-to-peer, public signalling server |
| Left behind after transfer | 30 days, browsable | nothing | nothing |
| Setup | deploy once, ~5 min | install, then open | just open the page |
| Per-item size limit | 25 MB | bounded by disk | bounded by the connection |

**Choose LocalSend if** both devices are on the same Wi-Fi, both in front of you, and the file is large. It is peer-to-peer, has no practical size ceiling, and needs no internet at all.

**Choose PairDrop if** you want zero setup and would rather not deploy anything. It is the shortest path from nothing to a transferred file.

**Choose shotsync if** you keep sending yourself screenshots and want them still there when you sit back down hours later, on a different machine, on a different network — and you would rather they lived in your own Cloudflare account than on a public image host. It replaces the habit of messaging things to yourself, not AirDrop.

**Do not choose shotsync if** you need per-user accounts: one shared token unlocks the whole pool. See the "Security model & limitations" section below before deploying.

## Features

- Cross-device image + text + file pool (a shared clipboard + screenshot drop)
- PWA gallery — "Add to Home Screen", no native app, no App Store
- Client-side HEIC→JPEG + thumbnail generation (mobile-friendly; the Worker does no image processing)
- Signed, expiring public share links (HMAC-SHA256, 7 days)
- Per-item save/download + multi-select batch delete
- Single-token auth, constant-time compare, token never in URLs
- 30-day auto-retention via R2 lifecycle
- Runs entirely on the Cloudflare free tier (Workers + R2)
- ~50 tests (Vitest + `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`)

## Deploy your own (~5 min)

Prereqs: a Cloudflare account, Node 18+, and **R2 enabled** (Dashboard → R2 → enable; Cloudflare asks for a card even on the free tier — the free allowance is not charged).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Defiabell/shotsync
cd shotsync
npm install
npx wrangler login

# 1. create the R2 bucket (name must match bucket_name in wrangler.toml)
npx wrangler r2 bucket create shotsync

# 2. set the shared access token — any long random string; you enter it on each device
openssl rand -hex 24                  # generate one, copy it
npx wrangler secret put AUTH_TOKEN    # paste it when prompted

# 3. deploy
npm run deploy
```

You also need a **workers.dev subdomain** (Dashboard → Workers & Pages, one-time) or a custom domain. After deploy you get `https://shotsync.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

### 30-day retention

Dashboard → R2 → bucket `shotsync` → Settings → Object lifecycle rules → delete objects 30 days after creation.

## Using it

The UI labels are in Chinese; the English in parentheses below maps each step to the button you'll see.

### 1. First time, on each device
1. Open your Worker URL (e.g. `https://shotsync.<subdomain>.workers.dev`).
2. Enter your `AUTH_TOKEN` when prompted — it's saved in `localStorage`, so you won't be asked again on that device.
3. (Optional) In Safari: **Share → Add to Home Screen** to install it as a PWA. It then runs full-screen like an app.

The gallery shows every item newest-first and auto-refreshes every ~20 s, so anything uploaded from another device appears within seconds.

### 2. Add things to the pool
- **Image** — tap **`+ 图片`** (Add image): pick from photos or camera. It's converted to JPEG and thumbnailed in your browser, then uploaded.
- **Text** — tap **`✎ 文字`** (Text), paste/type a snippet, then **`发送`** (Send). It becomes a text card — a cross-device clipboard.
- **File** — tap **`+ 文件`** (Add file): select a PDF, video, audio file, archive, document, or any other file. Its original name and MIME type are retained; each file is limited to 25 MB.
- **Mac screenshots, automatically** — install the [Mac menu-bar app](mac/README.md): every screenshot uploads on its own.
- **iOS share sheet** — set up the [Shortcut](shortcut/README.md) to push an image from any app's share sheet.

### 3. Open one item (tap it)
Tap any thumbnail/card to open it full-screen, then:
- **`保存` / `复制` / `下载`** (Save / Copy / Download) — image: save to Photos (mobile) or download (desktop); text: copy to clipboard; files: download or use the system share sheet.
- **`分享`** (Share) — mint a **7-day public link** to just that item, copied to your clipboard. Anyone with the link can view that one item; the rest of the pool stays private.
- **`删除`** (Delete) — remove this item.
- **`关闭`** (Close) — back to the gallery.

### 4. Delete many at once
1. Tap **`选择`** (Select) to enter selection mode.
2. Tap items to check them (blue outline); tap again to uncheck.
3. Tap **`删除选中 (N)`** (Delete selected) → confirm. Or **`取消`** (Cancel) to leave without deleting.

## Security model & limitations (please read)

- **Single shared token.** Anyone with the URL **and** token can view/upload/delete. This is a single-user / trusted-circle tool, not multi-tenant. Rotate with `npx wrangler secret put AUTH_TOKEN` — note this also invalidates all live share links, since the token is the link signing key.
- **Share links are public** until they expire (7 days): anyone with the link can see that one item.
- **Transit pool, not an archive.** Items auto-delete after 30 days by design.
- **The UI is currently in Chinese.** i18n PRs welcome.
- The Worker stores received bytes as-is (no server-side image processing); format conversion and thumbnails happen on the client.

## Development

```bash
npm test          # Vitest (workers pool) — full suite
npx tsc --noEmit  # type-check
npm run dev       # local dev — create a .dev.vars with AUTH_TOKEN=<anything>
```
